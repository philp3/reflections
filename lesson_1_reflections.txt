What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros of manually commiting are probably more related to having a right sized and logical commit. Some negatives to a manual commit are forgetting to commit and possibly losing your work

_-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is more geared toward programming which will have file dependencies. Google docs is geared toward office type of documents which are often stand-alone documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
